Generate data transformation based on the MDA(Model Driven Architecture).

For given RDF(*.tt) model in source and target, generate a rule based data transformation program from source data to target data from the models.

The instance data should be in JSON format which is complient to the RDF models respectively.

Conduct test cases for generated rule-based data transformation for several source json data.

## model
model/source/manufacturing-ontology.ttl
model/target/ghg-report-ontology.ttl
